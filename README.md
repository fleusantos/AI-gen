# 🦜🔗✏️EcrivAI
Automated blog writer that uses LangChain and GPT type LLMs for topic selection and content generation. Content is published to [this blog](https://github.com/runakie/ecrivai) (not ready yet).

> 🏗️ Under construction...


## Usage
### Prerequisites
1. 🐍 You will need a working install of [`conda`](https://www.anaconda.com/download#downloads).
2. 🔑 You will need an API key from OpenAI. You can create one for free [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

### Dev Environment Setup
1. Set up your API keys in a file called `.env` (see `.env.example` for an example)
2. Set up and activate conda environment
    ```bash
    conda env create -f conda.yml
    conda activate ecrivai
    ```

### CLI

> Note: Remember to activate your `ecrivai` conda environment before doing this (see above)

You can quickly generate a new original blog by running:

```
python ecrivai/add_blog.py
```

This will add a blog to a Markdown file in a directory called `content/`. You can also specify your own output directory by running this instead:
```
python ecrivai/add_blog.py --out-dir path/to/dir
```
